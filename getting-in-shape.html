            Getting in shape can be a real hassle, especially when you have no
            clue what you are doing. No one wants to spend all their time
            figuring out which method is worth it. That is why I put this
            article together to help find the best way to get strong without
            thinning your pockets in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's face it, having your own trainer to help keep you motivated
            and on track to reach your goals would be amazing, but you don't
            have an extra couple hundred to blow on a fancy gym and a personal
            coach. You're reading this to learn how to get strong for the least
            amount of money possible. So fear not, I'm here to guide you to the
            best way to reach your fitness goals on a budget.

          <h2>The factors that will make the difference</h2>
          <p>
            Like all things in life, putting in the extra effort goes a long way
            and exercise is no exception to the rule. There are factors you can
            control outside of fitness to maximize your results. I have put
            together a list of the ones that are most vital to supporting your
            fitness journey. That being said, I strongly recommend putting in
            the same amount of effort into these addons if you want to see any
            real result. Ignoring them will just result in you fighting against
            them yourself in trying to achieve your goals which would be a huge
            waste of effort and time.
          </p>
          <h3>Have a clear plan in mind</h3>
          <p>
            The most important of which is having a clear goal of what you want
            the outcome to be from your effort. Having these goals in mind will
            allow you to reverse engineer the outcome you're looking for. That
            could be as simple as having an idea of how strong you would like to
            look, including the muscle groups you want to improve. Or It could
            also be having a picture of the man or woman with your dream
            physique so it will always be top of mind. Whatever it is you want
            to use it gives you direction on how to train effectively to have
            that be your outcome.

                Working out only to lose weight is the best example of this.
                Many people go to the gym and get a membership that has them
                paying for every machine in the gym. When in reality they just
                need to burn more calories than they consume a day. Their whole
                problem is doing too much in the form of eating excess calories
                so they need to do something different if they want different
                results. This can be achieved rather cheaply, they simply need
                to monitor their intake of calories religiously with - my
                favorite app for this is Nutritionix Track. Instead of going to
                the gym they could just save their money on the gym membership,
                use it to buy some running shoes so they can get out and run. It
                isn’t until you really think about your goals that you are able
                to think about the best way to get there, that is why I consider
                it to be most important.

          <h3>Focusing on your diet</h3>
          <p>
            A proper diet is vital to lose weight and to gain muscle . This is
            true because if your goal is to lose weight it could completely be
            done through consuming less calories. So if you want to lose weight,
            focusing on your diet should be where you start. The simple rule of
            thumb is to consume 500 calories less than your maintenance amount
            to lose weight and 500 calories more to gain weight. If you don’t
            know your maintenance calorie amount now would be a good time to get
            a food scale to track them and if you don't already weigh yourself
            daily you should start.

            That is all to say that controlling your diet plays a major role in
            complementing what you do to get your dream physic. I didn't know it
            before but I was making this mistake for much of my life. My body is
            very efficient when it comes to burning calories and it does help if
            you are very active on top of that. I simply could not hold any
            weight and I lacked the calories to really gain the strength I
            wanted to. It wasn't until I saw this video by Alex Hormozi that I
            understood what I was missing, FOOD AND PROTEIN. Once I changed that
            I started to gain muscle for real it was almost magical the
            difference I made from such a small tweak. If you have tried diet
            after diet to either lose weight or gain muscle watch this video and
            only follow it to a tea, you will never take up a flash diet again.

                Sleep is often not really thought of when it comes to workout.
                Every time you push yourself to the limit you are creating
                little micro tears in your muscles. These tears end up healing
                into bigger muscles as you give them time to rest, which is why
                you feel sore when you exercise properly. So unless you are one
                of those sleepwalkers, your sleep time is your real muscles
                repair time. always get a good night's rest after exercise. It
                will keep your mind sharp and make sure you're growing's
                stronger as well.

          <h3>Try out Calisthenics workouts</h3>
          <p>
            Calisthenics is by far the cheapest option for anyone looking to
            build serious muscle. The whole principle behind it is working out
            with just the weight of your body, allowing you to become very
            explosive and gain unreal body control. This may sound limiting but
            when you really look into it, it’s a lot more than just push up and
            pistol squats. The way people build serious strength with
            calisthenics is by working different variations of traditional
            workouts like pull ups and push ups to increasingly stress the
            muscle group it targets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gains come from the number of reps/sets and the difficulty of
            the variation of the exercise you're capable of doing. This differs
            from strength training where you really just want to be in a low rep
            range close, lifting close to your one rep max. When your body is
            your only weight you have to get a little creative. Really, if you
            don’t have other equipment that is all you need to get strong. If
            you don’t believe me check out

          <h3>Build your own Home Gym</h3>
          <p>
            Making your own home gym is perfect for anyone who doesn’t want to
            commute to the gym just to get in shape. It makes it super
            convenient to wake up in the morning and get to work. The best part
            about it is you always have a reason to just get a little workout
            in. It cuts out the hassle of traveling to work out removing the
            friction from doing what you should.
          </p>
          <p>
            Best part about it is you can set it up however you like. If you're
            trying to lose some extra weight, make space for an exercise bike
            and or a treadmill. If you want to build some muscle get a squat
            rack and a bench. The possibilities are endless when you customize
            your home gym to your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to what you came for, building serious strength on a budget.
            The only equipment you will need is a pair of adjustable dumbbells
            and an adjustable bench. With that setup you can work all of your
            muscle groups effectively. Your only limit will be how high your max
            weight is for your dumbbells set. If you invest in heavy enough
            weight you will have a setup that can bring from scrawny to jacked
            and never need replacement.

                  Adjustable weights are a game changer for a home gym. They are
                  so much more compact then buy all the individual weights
                  making them fit almost anywhere. Most importantly you will
                  easily be able to up you weight without being limited to have
                  to up your rep/set count.

            The last option is going to your local commercial gym. If you go to

            as *$16.25 a month.

            You will also have so much more options in terms of equipment making
            it much better if you are looking for variety and don't have space
            for the machines. Keep in mind that if you're just getting started,
            having all these options can lead to you wasting a lot of time just
            deciding what you want to do or how to do it. Always go to the gym
            with a plan or you will end up wasting a lot of time there not
            exercising.
